# Project Reinforcement Learning(RL) for Lunar Lander.
## **Description**:
1. Project used "**Stable-baseline3**" and "**Gymnasium**" to train Reinforcement Learning Model for Luna Lander environment.
2. To run project, you need install required system packages and python libraries.
## **Installation steps**
1. Install system packages (Linux/Ubuntu)
    + Before install Python Libraries, you must install necessary system packages
    + ```bash
      install.sh
      
2. Install Python libraries:
    + All necessary libraries are described in "requirements.txt"
## **Conclusion**:
1. After run project, you will have Reinforcement Learning for Lunar Lander with good parameter.
2. Point of this model is good. is is about 220 +- 50.
3. You can see Video of agent to render function.
## **Restriction**:
1. This model works pretty well but standard deviation is quite big.
2. Parameter are best optimized.
## **Solution**:
1. Optimize parameter and train model with higher learning_step.
2. Choose better algorithm for Lunar Lander.
